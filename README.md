In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

#### Methods Used
HTML/Bootstrap, JavaScript Library Plotly, Python\
I used Plotyly to create charts exploring the provided data and apply the app to an interactive dashboard
Webiste is deployed on GitHub Pages: https://jhamm2315.github.io/plotly_challenge/
